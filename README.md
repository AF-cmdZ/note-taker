## Note for grader:

Please clone repo, then 'npm install', then 'npm start', then open browser to localhost:3000. You do not need to type in 'node index.js' as this is an unnecessary step. If you want to type in 'node app/index.js' after you type in 'npm start' it will just tell you that the server is running on port 3000. The previous grader typed in 'node index.js' which will not work because my index file is in the app folder. That is why in my package.json I have "start": node app/index.js so that it takes care of this step for you when you type 'npm start'. I used my professors node starter template and all of these files are setup differently and it caused confusion. I will not use these anymore. Thank you!
